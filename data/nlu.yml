responses:
  utter_faq/osm_intro:
  - text: OpenStreetMap is a free digital map of the world, created by an ever growing community of mappers. It can be accessed through www.openstreetmap.org.
  utter_faq/osm_motive:
  - text: OpenStreetMap(OSM) was established to encourage the growth, development and distribution of free geospatial data and to provide geospatial data for anybody to use and shareâ€‹.
  - text: The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map data across much of the world.
  uter_faq/osm_spelling:
  - text: OpenStreetMap is the correct spelling. One word, three capital letters, one map. OpenStreetMap is also a Trademark.
  utter_faq/osm_founded:
  - text: Steve Coast founded the OpenStreetMap project in 2004, initially focusing on mapping the United Kingdom
  utter_faq/osm_alternatives:
  - text: Because that data is copyrighted and owned by Google/whoever and sometimes data itself powering this services is not available at all, or blocked by unfriendly licensing or extreme fees. Whle OSM is always fexible and free to users.
  utter_faq/osm_data_accuracy:
  - text: OpenStreetMap follows wiki style process. The essence of a wiki-style process is that all users have a stake in having accurate data. If one person puts in inaccurate data, maliciously or accidentally, the other 99.9% of people can check it, fix it, or get rid of it.
  utter_faq/osm_data_creator:
  - text: The data is collected from many keen contributors, and sporadic imports of data from open-licensed sources. In areas where there are no such data sources (most areas) we have to start from a blank slate, and head out there to survey the streets ourselves.
  utter_faq/osm_owner:
  - text: You. The data and software is owned by you, the contributors. There is an organisation called the OpenStreetMap Foundation which exists to protect, promote, and support the project, but does not own the data.
  utter_faq/osm_data_consistency:
  - text: OpenStreetMap is a free editable map of the whole world. It is made by people like you. Which means the database will always be subject to the whims, experimentation, and mistakes of the community; this is precisely OSM's strength since, among other things, it allows our data to quickly accommodate changes in the physical world.
  utter_faq/osm_involvement:
  - text: Anyone can help by improving map data. You can create an account at openstreetmap.org and start editing data using iD editor or other editor of your choice.
  utter_faq/osm_communicate:
  - text: The OpenStreetMap community is large, spread across many locations, speak different languages, and focus on different areas of interest. There is a help center at help.openstreetmap.org and forum at forum.openstreetmap.org to get started.
  utter_faq/osm_see_changes:
  - text: The "standard" map appearing on OpenStreetMap.org tends to be updated after a couple of minutes, but can also be longer depending on server load.
  utter_faq/osm_need_gps:
  - text: No we have numerous data sources that can be used to determine an accurate position, including aerial imagery from Bing, and of course the existing OpenStreetMap data.
  utter_faq/osm_satellite_image_resolution:
  - text: OpenStreetMap neither controls nor owns the satellite imagery. The Aerial Imagery is from a variety of sources that we have permission to use - Bing and Maxar are the most popular and have the largest coverage. So we cannot make or request updates.
  utter_faq/osm_can_use_data:
  - text: Yes! You must follow rules. Typically it means that you must provide an attribution.
  utter_faq/osm_map_download:
  - text: Use the 'Share' button to download in PNG, JPEG, SVG or PDF format. If you need other formats, see the https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Export page.
  utter_faq/osm_download_data:
  - text: There are two ways you can get data out of the OSM database. One is by using Overpass, a separate API with a powerful query language. The second is to download the OpenStreetMap data dump and filter it according to your needs.
